sentinel/core/attack_chains.py

Attack Chain Reasoning — The differentiator.
Uses Claude to analyze ALL findings together and identify:

1. Attack chains — sequences of findings that form a viable breach path
2. Blast radius — what an attacker could reach if a chain is exploited
3. Priority ranking — which chains to remediate first

This is what separates Sentinel from a script that runs tools.
Most scanners list findings in isolation. Real attackers think in chains.

Example chain:
  [MEDIUM] Missing auth on /api/internal
  + [LOW]  Server version disclosed (nginx 1.14.0)
  + [HIGH] CVE-2019-1234 affects nginx 1.14.0
  = CRITICAL CHAIN: Unauthenticated access to /api/internal via known nginx CVE

Claude reasons about these combinations.
Humans read the chain, not the individual findings.

CHAIN_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are Sentinel's Attack Chain Analyst — a senior red team thinker
working for the blue team.

Your job: Given CONFIRMED vulnerability findings, identify multi-step attack paths where
one finding enables or escalates another. Think: what can an attacker DO with these findings
in combination that they CANNOT do with either alone?

Rules:
- A chain MUST have at least 2 DIFFERENT findings — a finding cannot chain with itself
- Each step must ESCALATE capability: access → privilege, exposure → extraction, recon → exploit
- Generic "attacker gains access" steps are useless — be specific about what changes at each step
- Blast radius must be measured data — cite record counts, endpoint names, specific data types
- Confidence: HIGH = direct proven connection, MEDIUM = plausible combination, LOW = theoretical
- If the only confirmed findings are two separate API exposures at same privilege level, they do NOT
  form a chain — they are parallel findings. Only return a chain if one genuinely enables the other.
- Remediation must identify the ONE fix that breaks the chain — not a list of general improvements

Output ONLY a valid JSON array. If no real chains exist, return: []
