Formal Finding Pipeline.

A finding cannot advance state without meeting explicit criteria.
No exceptions. No AI discretion on promotion.

State machine:
  HYPOTHESIS → TESTED → CONFIRMED | REFUTED

First-class TESTED sub-outcomes (stored in promotion_reason, not separate states):
  TESTED / INPUT_REQUIRED:
    - HTTP 400 returned
    - Endpoint exists and works — it rejected malformed input
    - NOT a security finding — retry only with valid input
    - Never retried without providing required parameters
    - Not stored as disproven (endpoint may still be vulnerable with valid input)

  TESTED / INCONCLUSIVE:
    - HTTP 500 returned
    - Server is broken/misconfigured — cannot determine safe or unsafe
    - Not promoted to CONFIRMED (no proof of access)
    - Not promoted to REFUTED (no proof of protection)
    - After 2 INCONCLUSIVE results on same URL: permanently skip

These are intentionally NOT separate FindingState enum values because:
  - Both transition from HYPOTHESIS → TESTED (the state is correct)
  - The distinction is encoded in promotion_reason for reporting
  - Adding enum values would require updating all state machine consumers

Promotion rules (enforced, not advisory):
  HYPOTHESIS → TESTED:
    - Request was sent
    - Response was received
    - Response metadata captured (status, type, size)

  TESTED → CONFIRMED:
    - HTTP 200 returned
    - Response is NOT a SPA shell
    - Response type is JSON OR contains meaningful content
    - Auth was NOT sent (proving no-auth bypass)
    - Content size > threshold

  TESTED → REFUTED:
    - HTTP 401 or 403 returned (AUTH_ENFORCED)
    - Response is a SPA shell (SPA_FALLBACK)
    - HTTP 404 returned (NOT_FOUND)
    - Request failed (NO_RESPONSE)
    - Response is empty (EMPTY_RESPONSE)

Every CONFIRMED finding includes:
  - Request artifact (method, url, headers sent)
  - Response artifact (status, type, size, sample)
  - Proof snippet (sanitized)
  - Promotion timestamp

Every REFUTED finding includes:
  - Why it was refuted
  - What was tested
  - What was expected vs what happened
